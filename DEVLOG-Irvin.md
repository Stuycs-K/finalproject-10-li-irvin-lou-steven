### 2025-05-16 Research Elliptic Curve Cryptography
Researched the different project ideas and eventually decided to commit to doing Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
Stored research in a google doc (as a way to reference when creating the video later).
Basic Overview:
-Eliptic Curve Cryptography is an assymetric Cryptography and relies on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem to create a secure encryption.
-It has smaller key sizes compared to RSA.
Verified that there is a way to test almost every step in the process.

# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Irvin Li, Steven Lou
       
# Intentions:

Emulating ECC encryption algorithm with pregiven elliptic curve parameters (eg. secp256k1)
    
# Intended usage:

The user should use make run ARGS"ARG1 ARG2", where ARG1 is the elliptic curve mode, and ARG2 for the message.
  
# Technical Details:



# Intended pacing:

A timeline with expected completion dates of parts of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

Monday 05/19/25
- Necessary operations (primarily for elliptic curve calculations ie. Point addition, Point multiplication)

Wednesday/Thursday 05/21-22/25
- Key Generation schematic and message signing

Friday 05/22/25
- Testing/Verification/adding args

Tuesday 05/23/25
-Final Touches/Makefile/Video

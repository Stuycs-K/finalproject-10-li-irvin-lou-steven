Spent time researching about Elliptic Curve Cryptography(ECC) and recorded our notes in a google doc. It is an asymmetric key cipher used in modern day cryptography, which uses the properties of elliptic curves (in particular the irreversibility of point multiplication as long as the decisional Diffieâ€“Hellman (DDH) assumption holds) to generate a public/private key pair. A unique signature is generated based on the hash and the private key, which can be verified through mathematical formulae and the public key. The ECDH protocol can also be used between two parties to encrypt and share messages by generating the same symmetric key through an insecure channel. We also did some preliminary research into hash libraries and parameters to ensure this was implementable and testable.

For the entire class and for homework, I implemented the Point java class and point muliplication and addition in the Operations java class. I tested both of them, but the multiplication and addition does not match up witht he values found for the paramters online, so further debugging must be done to figure out what's wrong.

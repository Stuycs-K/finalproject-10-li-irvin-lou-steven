### What is ECC?
Elliptic Curve Cryptography is an example of asymmetric cryptography in which there is a public and private key.
It uses the principle of elliptic curves over finite fields in order to provide cryptographically secure points and efficient operations. It is used to create signatures to ensure security in encryption.

### What is ECC?
Elliptic Curve Cryptography is an example of asymmetric cryptography in which there is a public and private key.
It uses the principle of elliptic curves over finite fields in order to provide cryptographically secure points and efficient operations. It is used to create signatures to ensure security in encryption or as a part of other more expanded forms of encryption. 

A main benefit of ECC as opposed to industry standards like RSA would be the much smaller keys in comparison to other forms due to the concept known as te Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP).

Points $P$ and $Q = kP$
where Points $P$ and $Q$ are on the elliptical curve and $k$ is a constant that is very difficult to find out as a result of random.
